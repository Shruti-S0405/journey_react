# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

<!-- POP QUIZ -->

**// All the elements I render get put inside the div with the id of "root"
//(or whatever other element I might select when calling createRoot)

// You can only render 1 parent element at a time. That parent element can have
//as many children **elements** as you want.

// console.log(<h1>Hello world!</h1>)
// ```
// An object! Unlike creating an HTML element in vanilla DOM JS, what
// gets created from the JSX we have in our React code is a plain JS object
// that React will use to fill in the view.

// *Imperative* means we need to give specific step-by-step instructions on how to
// accomplish a task.
// *Declarative* means we can write our code to simply "describe" *what* should show up
// on the page and allow the rool (React, e.g.) to handle the details on *how* to 
// put those things on the page.

// composable: - We have small pieces that we can put together to make something
// larger or greater than the individual pieces themselves.
